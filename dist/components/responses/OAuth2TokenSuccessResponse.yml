        Access Token

        [The OAuth2.0 Authorization Framework - 1.4. Access Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.4)

        Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server.

      required:
        - access_token
        - token_type

            The type of the token issued as described in [Section 7.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-7.1).  Value is case insensitive.

            **RECOMMENDED**. The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will expire in one hour from the time the response was generated. If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the expiration time via other means or document the default value.
          type: integer
          example: 3600
        refresh_token:
          description: |-
