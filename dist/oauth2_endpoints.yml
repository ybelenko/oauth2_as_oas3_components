    This document omits authorization endpoint on purpose. I don't know how to describe it with OAS3 since endpoint response isn't JSON(html page). If you have any suggestion please submit an issue to this repo.

        Access Token

        [The OAuth2.0 Authorization Framework - 1.4. Access Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.4)

        Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server.

For example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will expire in one hour from the time the response was generated. If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the expiration time via other means or document the default value.
